## Hotel Dashboard: Project Overview
* Built a dashboard with PowerBI to present to stakeholders
* Created a sample dashboard in PowerBI using SQL queries to answer business questions:
* "Is our revenue growing by year?"
* "Should we increase our parking lot size?"
* "What trends can we see in the data?"

## Resources Used
* Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 2018
* Microsoft PowerBI
* Sample data from [Absentdata.com](https://www.absentdata.com/hotel_revenue_historical_full/)

## Using SQL to create queries to load into PowerBI
* Used SSMS18 to combine hotel data tables for years 2018 to 2020
* Wrote a query to calculate yearly revenue by multiplying the daily rate by total nights nights stayed
* Loaded the query into PowerBI for visualization and analysis

## Building Dashboard in PowerBI
* Split Interactive Dashboard into 3 segments
* First Segment includes:
  * Total Revenue between 2018 and 2020
  * The average daily rate
  * Total nights booked
  * The average discount
  * The total number of parking spaces used
  * A dropdown list to view data by country
  * A dropdown list to view data by hotel
  * A date slider to see data anywhere between January 1st, 2018 and September 14th, 2020
* Second Segment includes:
  * Line graph to compare revenue earned by the city hotel and the resort hotel
* Last Segment includes:
  * Table with total revenue split by year and hotel
  * Number of parking spaces used each year along with percentage of spots used (percentage of parking lot used)
  * Donut chart showcasing total revenue by hotel
